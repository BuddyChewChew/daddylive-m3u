**Important:** Due to TinyURLâ€™s use of Cloudflare, the playlist short links have been updated from TinyURL to Bit.ly. The old TinyURL links will continue to work once the protective mode is lifted, but it's recommended to switch to the new Bit.ly links.

# DaddyLive Live TV & Sports Playlists

DaddyLive is a platform that offers free live TV and sports streaming across selected categories. Users can stream and watch live TV directly through their browser without the need for an account or subscription.

For added flexibility, this repository provides an M3U playlist featuring DaddyLive's channels. With this, you can load the streams into any IPTV application that supports M3U-formatted playlists.

You can view the full list of channels provided by DaddyLive [here](https://href.li/?https://dlhd.so/24-7-channels.php). 

**Note:** Adult channels have been excluded from the main playlist. If you wish to include these channels, the playlists can be found [here](https://github.com/dtankdempse/daddylive-m3u/tree/main/adult).

## Playlist Formats:

  A standard M3U playlist. If you're using this playlist, make sure your IPTV application allows the setting of a custom `Referer` and `User-Agent` header. The headers must be set in order to access the streams. Failure to set the required headers will result in a 403 error when attempting to stream.

If none of these playlists work with your IPTV application, you can try using the [m3u-playlist-proxy](https://github.com/dtankdempse/m3u-playlist-proxy). This proxy acts as a middle layer to help resolve potential issues with playing the playlists, especially if your IPTV app doesn't support setting the required headers.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Choose the playlist format that suits your application or media player.
2. Add the playlist URL to your IPTV application.
3. Ensure that your application supports the required settings, such as setting the required headers for streams to play.
